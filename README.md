# Obsidian Plugin for Auto-Load a Link Title
![Auto linking example](auto-link-title.gif)

## What is the difference to the original implementation? 🤨

This project is forked from [obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin](https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title) and has several benefits over the original implementation:

1. We do not use the external service `api.linkpreview.net` to get web page titles. Instead, we load the original page and extract `<title>` from its HTML structure.
2. We reviewed this plugin to ensure it does not lack personal information from the plugin to the outside. It was the main reason to fork and have a frozen version of the plugin, to be sure that it won't have some update that may hurt your personal notes.

### Automatically Title New Links
This plugin automatically fetches the webpage to extract link titles when they're pasted, creating a markdown link with the correct title set.

#### For example:

When pasting `https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title` the plugin fetches the page and retrieves the title, resulting in a paste of: `[zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title: Automatically fetch the titles of pasted links](https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title)`

### Add Titles To Existing Raw URLs
Additionally, using `ctrl-shift-e` (Windows) or `cmd-shift-e` (OS X) you can enhance an existing raw link to a markdown formatted link with the proper title.

If your text cursor is within the url `https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title` pressing `ctrl-shift-e` or `cmd-shift-e` converts the text to `[zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title: Automatically fetch the titles of pasted links](https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title)`

### Overwrite Titles Of Existing Markdown Links
Additionally, using `ctrl-shift-e` (Windows) or `cmd-shift-e` (OS X) you can overwrite an existing title of a markdown link with the fetched title from the url.

If your text cursor is within `[some plugin](https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title)` pressing `ctrl+shift+e` fetches the sites title and replaces it, resulting in `[zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title: Automatically fetch the titles of pasted links](https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title)`

### Mobile Pasting
In order to paste the URL ensure you perform the `Tap and Hold -> Paste` action to paste the URL into your document.

#### Gboard
Google's [Gboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin&hl=en_US&gl=US) keyboard has a Clipboard helper shortcut above the keyboard to quickly paste.
Due to the implementation of that feature, it does not trigger the `paste` event, preventing this plugin from interacting with the text.
